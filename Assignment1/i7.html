            <h2>The (up)vote flower</h2>
            <p>The life of this digital flower can be controlled with the up- and downvote button. The flower will grow whenever the internet decides to give this plant enough upvotes</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Our assignment is based on the <a href="http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/garden/Ars/" class = "linka"> Telegarden</a> project done by Ken Goldberg and Joseph Santarromana. The Telegarden is a physical garden with a robotic arm. This arm is controlled with input of the internet, web users can see and water the garden.</p>
            <p>We decided to remake this project in our own way. The concept of this project is to remind people that our beautiful, but vulnerable nature needs to be taken care off. The idea of the up- and downvotes should create the feeling that humankind has a direct impact on, and relationship with nature.</p>
            <p>The page is made with HTML and CSS. The up- and downvote button is a modified piece of javascript which was found on the internet. The 8 phases of a plant itâ€™s life are made in blender3D. All elements combined resulted in a page which illustrates our initial idea of creating more awareness about nature. </p>
            <p>For future explorations we do like to completely reverse the original project relationship between real- and computerlife. This reverse will happen if a subset of specific events happen in the real world (deforestation and planting of new trees). Whenever such specific event happens our plant will shrink or grow.</p>
